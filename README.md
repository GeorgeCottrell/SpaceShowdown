A take on an arcade style space shooter game. 

My first attempt at making a "Megamania" style space shooter game. It's pretty basic right now with most of the main elements in place. The vehicles and background are freebies from the internet.
Once the gameplay is worked out better I'd want to replace the graphics with custom ones. 

I can't figure out how to get the enemy ships to move the way I want them to. I want it more like megamania where the ships move in different ways each round. 

The bonus counter isn't working correctly. It should reset the streak and start recounting the bonus on any missed shot. 

The initial entry is slow. For some reason it takes multiple key presses to get a character to show. 

Even right now it is pretty fun, but it could really be fun with a little more work.
